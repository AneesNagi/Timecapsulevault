## Project Overview

### Vision Statement
I envision a world where individuals can securely save and grow their cryptocurrency assets with the same confidence and automation as traditional banking, but with the transparency and control that only blockchain technology can provide.

### Mission Statement
To democratize secure crypto savings by providing an intuitive, automated, and transparent platform that eliminates the barriers to responsible cryptocurrency management.

### Core Value Proposition
TimeCapsule CryptoVault offers three revolutionary features:
1. **Time-Locked Vaults**: Secure funds for predetermined periods
2. **Price-Locked Vaults**: Automatically unlock when target prices are reached
3. **Goal-Based Vaults**: Save towards specific financial objectives

```solidity
// TimeCapsuleVault.sol - Main Vault Contract
contract TimeCapsuleVault {
    // Core functionality
    function deposit() external payable
    function withdraw() external
    function checkAndExecuteAutoWithdraw() internal
    
    // Lock mechanisms
    modifier timeLocked()
    modifier priceLocked()
    modifier goalLocked()
    
    // Automation
    function triggerAutoWithdraw() external

}
```

#### 2. **Factory Pattern Implementation**

```solidity
// VaultFactory.sol - Vault Creation & Management
contract VaultFactory {
    mapping(address => address[]) public userVaults;
    
    function createVault(
        uint256 lockType,
        uint256 lockDuration,
        uint256 targetPrice,
        uint256 goalAmount
    ) external returns (address)
}
```

#### 3. **Automation System**

```solidity
// VaultAutomation.sol - Chainlink Automation
contract VaultAutomation {
    function checkUpkeep(bytes calldata) external view returns (bool, bytes memory)
    function performUpkeep(bytes calldata) external
    
    // Batch processing for gas efficiency
    uint256 constant MAX_VAULTS_PER_UPKEEP = 10;
}
```

### User Flow Diagrams

#### State Management
```typescript
// Custom hooks for state management
const useVault = () => {
  const [vaults, setVaults] = useState<VaultData[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  
  // Vault operations
  const createVault = async (params: VaultParams) => { /* ... */ };
  const deposit = async (vaultAddress: string, amount: bigint) => { /* ... */ };
  const withdraw = async (vaultAddress: string) => { /* ... */ };
  
  return { vaults, loading, error, createVault, deposit, withdraw };
};
```

### Automation System

#### Chainlink Automation Flow
```
1. Chainlink Node monitors vault conditions
2. checkUpkeep() called every block
3. If conditions met, performUpkeep() executed
4. Batch processing for gas efficiency
5. User notification sent
6. Vault state updated
```

#### Gas Optimization Strategy
```solidity
// Batch processing example
function performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external {
    address[] memory vaults = abi.decode(performData, (address[]));
    
    for (uint i = 0; i < vaults.length; i++) {
        if (canAutoWithdraw(vaults[i])) {
            executeWithdrawal(vaults[i]);
        }
